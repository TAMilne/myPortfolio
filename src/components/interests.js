        <h2> Hobbies and Interests</h2>
        <b>Family</b><br/>
        <p>Spending time with my family is the biggest joy of my life. My wife and I have been married since 2018, and we welcomed our daughter, Harlowe, in July of 2020.</p><br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Sports</b><br/>
        <p>Organized sports have been a major aspect of my life. I first started playing hockey at the ripe age of 5 years old, playing through all major levels of minor hockey, and have continued to play in mens league ever since. I also enjoy Baseball, Football, Golf, and Lacrosse.</p><br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Backpacking and Hiking</b><br/>
        <p>I developed a passion for the outdoors at an ealry age, in large part to my participation in Scouts Canada. Myself and a group of lifelong friends have a standing annual backpacking trip into the mountains, famously titled Too Much Man, Not Enough Mountain. It is a highlight every year for all of us.</p><br/>
        <br/>
        <b>Video Games</b><br/>
        <p>Two of my most memorable christmas's growing up, were recieving my N64, and my Gameboy Color. Video games and provided endless enjoyment throughout my life, but it is the social aspect of video games I enjoy most now. I'm fortunate to have a great group of life long friends, and one of the methods that have enabled us to remain as close as we are, is our ability to game together</p><br/>
